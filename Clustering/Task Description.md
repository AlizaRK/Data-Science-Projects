# Task Description
This task was part of course CS 457 Data Science.

## Task
1. Need to clean the data. Remove columns Category and Item for clustering purpose. 
2. You may drop column Serving Size. If not, then you need to clean the values and get 
oz or g values and then remove the units. 
3. Scale (normalize) the data before clustering. 
4. Generate WSS (Knee Plot) to find optimal number of clusters. You can also plot 
Silhouette Coefficient plot to support your answer. 
5. Perform K-Means clustering again with optimal number of clusters. 
6. Visualize the clustering results. 
7. Use cluster labels to your original dataset to create cluster specific data frames. 
8. Generate at least 3 insights from your clustering results to show unique and 
interesting features for each cluster. Discuss your findings. 
9. Can you suggest a unique name for each cluster? For example if a cluster is showing 
high Sugar level, then you can call it a “SugarLovers” cluster.
