# Task Description
This task was part of course CS 457 Data Science. 

## Tasks
1. Create a regression model between TotalWorkingYears and MonthlyIncome 
(response variable). Show the scatter plot with regression line between them 
2. Create a regression model between Age and DistanceFromHome (response variable). 
Show the scatter plot with regression line between them 
3. Calculate Correlation for (1) and (2) and explain the values to support your answer.  
4. Create a regression model to predict MonthlyIncome using all other inputs. Discuss 
the effectiveness of the model. Report 3 most significant inputs and 3 least significant 
inputs and interpret the results. Create a new input and show the prediction of 
MonthlyIncome using the same model. 
5. Create a regression model to predict HourlyRate using all other inputs. Discuss the 
effectiveness of the model. Report 3 most significant inputs and 3 least significant 
inputs and interpret the results. Create a new input and show the prediction of 
HourlyRate using the same model. 
6. Select only top 3 inputs (based on p-value) from (Question 4) and create a new model 
to predict MonthlyIncome. (If you are picking a categorical column for one of your 
top 3 columns, lets say JobRole, then make sure to add all the one hot encoded 
columns for JobRole and it will be counted as one top input). Discuss the 
performance of the model using few inputs as compared to using all inputs in 
(Question 4). Which model do you prefer and why? 
a. The idea is to create a simple generalized model with fewer inputs which are 
important for prediction. For this concept, please research and study 
“Regularization in Regression”
