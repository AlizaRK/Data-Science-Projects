# Task Description
This task was part of course CS 457 Data Science. 

## Task
1. Read the dataset visualize the trend, seasonality, residual etc. Discuss your 
observations in the visualization. 
2. Split the data into train and test sets. Use all the data for year 2020 for training and 
2021 for testing. 
3. Use ARIMA, visualize the results and report the RMSE. 
4. Use SARIMA, visualize the results and report the RMSE. 
5. Try to come up with optimal parameters for SARIMA. Pick the best one, visualize the 
results and then report the RMSE. Compare both ARIMA and SARIMA and 
conclude which one is better? 
6. Now use any two Machine Learning regressor techniques and use the same training 
and testing set (used for ARIMA and SARIMA). Visualize the results and report the 
RMSE. 
7. Compare all the RMSEs (ARIMA, SARIMA and two regression algorithms) and 
discuss which one is better. 
8. Generate future dates from April 1st 2022 to June 30th 2022 and predict the price 
using SARIMA model (with optimal parameters). 
9. Using the same future dates, predict the price using any one ML regression model  
10. Visualize the predictions from 9 and 10 and discuss their differences.
